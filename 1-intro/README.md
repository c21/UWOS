# Introduction to C and Unix (09/07/2016)
Slides for discussion is [here](https://github.com/c21/UWOS/blob/master/1-intro/slides/slides.pdf), and code for demo is [here](https://github.com/c21/UWOS/tree/master/1-intro/demo). This page is to talk something we don't have time to cover in discussion.  

# Welcome to C
C is an old programming language which was born during 1970s! It's old though, but it's still very powerful.

If you never learn programming, C is a good choice as your first language. You can read [this book](https://learncodethehardway.org/c) and [this tutorial](http://www.learn-c.org) to learn C.

If you have learned programming(mostly Java, I guess?), but never touch C and C++, you can read the [K&R C book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) to learn C.

If you have learned C(mostly in CS354, I guess?), well, welcome on board! You should definitely pay more attention to the usage and design of operating system(that's the whole point of this course, right?). But, in case you never read the [K&R C book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628), I definitely encourage you to read it. It's a good book for experienced programmer.

If you are a programming geek(mostly major in CS, I guess?), and interested in everything(history, gossip, funny bug, mysterious feature) about C, you can have a look of [Expert C Programming book](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298). E.g., why **gcc my.c -lm** works, but **gcc -lm my.c** doesn't work (... well, this bizarre problem only occurred in [old gcc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11336477/gcc-will-not-properly-include-math-h))?
